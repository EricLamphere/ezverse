The `ezverse` is intended to make various aspects of data science, automated reporting, and data exploration much easier (ezâ€¦ get it?). Currently, the `ezverse` is comprised of the following packages:

* [**ezxfig**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezxfig.git)
* [**ezexplore**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezexplore.git)
* [**ezdates**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezdates.git)
* [**ezviz**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezviz.git)
* [**ezextras**](https://github.com/EricLamphere/ezextras.git)

The goal of *this* package specifically is to mimic much of the `tidyverse` methodology in making it very easy to install and load core packages from the `ezverse`.

## Installation
